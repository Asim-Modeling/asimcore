This directory contains module variant for the "simulation core",
i.e. a modular version of what libasim.a provides, namely base classes
for ports, clocks, modules, etc., and a clock server.

It also contains modules for libasim and libdral, for use with the
"version 3" system modules, so you can choose which version of libasim
independently (the legacy libasim.a, or the single- or multi-threaded versions).
